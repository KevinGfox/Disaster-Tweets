# Disaster-Tweets
NLp competition on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
> I used deep learning models to classify tweets. 
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : Make an EDA
- Part 2 : Make the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for deep learning models
- Part 3 : Train two models and identify the early stoping point
